   <desc>Rogue Squadron is a starfighter squadron in the Star Wars franchise. Many surviving members of Red Squadron, the X-wing attack force that Luke Skywalker joins during the Battle of Yavin in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), later join Rogue Squadron. The squadron appears in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as Rogue Group. In the 2016 film Rogue One, Rebel fighters on a suicide mission to steal the plans for the Death Star self-identify as "Rogue One", a possible precursor to Rogue Squadron.[1]</desc>
   <desc>Rogue Squadron is prominently featured in the comic book series Star Wars: X-wing, the ten-volume novel series Star Wars: X-wing, and the video game series Star Wars: Rogue Squadron. The unit is depicted as consisting of "the best pilots and the best fighters".[2]</desc>
